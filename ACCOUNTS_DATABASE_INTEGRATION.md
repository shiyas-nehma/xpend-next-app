# Accounts Database Integration

This document describes the database integration for the Accounts page in the Xpend Next.js application.

## Overview

The Accounts page has been integrated with Firebase Firestore to provide persistent storage for user account data. Users can now create, read, update, and delete their financial accounts with real-time data synchronization.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Add new financial accounts (Checking, Savings, Credit Card, Investment, Loan)
- **Read**: Fetch and display user's accounts with real-time updates
- **Update**: Edit account details including name, institution, balance, and type
- **Delete**: Remove accounts with confirmation

### ✅ Security
- User authentication required for all operations
- Firestore security rules ensure users can only access their own data
- Data validation on both client and server side

### ✅ User Experience
- Loading states for all async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Optimistic updates for better responsiveness
- Real-time data synchronization

## Technical Implementation

   - Updated to use database instead of mock data
   - Integrated authentication checks
   - Added loading and error states

4. **`src/components/common/LoadingSpinner.tsx`**
   - Reusable loading component
   - Multiple size variants

5. **`src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx`**
   - Error boundary for graceful error handling
   - Fallback UI for unexpected errors

6. **`firestore.rules`**
   - Security rules for Firestore collections
   - User-based access control

### Database Schema

```typescript
interface Account {
  id: number;                    // Numeric ID for frontend compatibility
  name: string;                  // Account name (e.g., "Chase Checking")
  type: AccountType;             // Account type enum
  balance: number;               // Current balance
  institution?: string;          // Bank/institution name
  description?: string;          // Optional description
  lastUpdated?: string;          // ISO timestamp
  userId: string;                // Firebase Auth UID (backend only)
}

type AccountType = 'Checking' | 'Savings' | 'Credit Card' | 'Investment' | 'Loan';
```

### Security Rules

The Firestore security rules ensure:
- Only authenticated users can access the database
- Users can only read/write their own account data
- All operations require valid user authentication

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration
Ensure your Firebase project is configured with:
- Authentication enabled
- Firestore database created
- Security rules deployed

### 2. Environment Variables
Make sure these environment variables are set:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# ... other Firebase config variables
```

### 3. Deploy Security Rules
Copy the content from `firestore.rules` to your Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
2. Replace existing rules with the content from `firestore.rules`
3. Publish the rules

## Usage

### Adding an Account
1. Click "Add New Account" button
2. Fill in account details in the modal
3. Click "Save" to create the account
4. Account appears in the list with success toast

### Editing an Account
1. Hover over an account card
2. Click the edit (pencil) icon
3. Modify details in the modal
4. Click "Save" to update

### Deleting an Account
1. Hover over an account card
2. Click the delete (trash) icon
3. Confirm deletion in the confirmation modal
4. Account is removed with info toast

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network errors are caught and displayed to users
- Authentication errors redirect to login
- Validation errors show specific messages
- Unexpected errors are caught by error boundaries

## Performance Considerations

- Real-time listeners for live data updates
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Efficient query patterns with user-based filtering
- Loading states prevent UI blocking

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Offline support with Firebase offline persistence
- Bulk operations for multiple accounts
- Account import from bank APIs
- Data export functionality
- Account categorization and tagging
